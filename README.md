# Basic Task Manager

### Description
I built this app to learn about Laravel (esp. implementing RESTful APIs).
**WARNING**- The program is NOT thoroughly tested.
---
### Instructions
#### For running entirely on localhost
1. Please install *composer* and make its installation global. Read [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#locally)
2. To install laravel, run in a shell `composer global require laravel/installer`
3. Read about setting composer vendor bin as global [here](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/installation). This will also be a helper on how to install Laravel.
4. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/TipsByPullak/basic_task_manager`
5. cd into this repo `cd basic_task_manager` and run `php artisan serve`
6. See the *API Endpoints* section at the end for reference.
